# Scripts (`scripts/`)

This directory contains utility scripts used for development, building, deployment, or other automation tasks related to the project.

## Architecture

-   **`build.ts`**: A script likely responsible for compiling TypeScript code, bundling assets, or performing other build-related tasks for one or more packages in the monorepo.
