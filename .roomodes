      "roleDefinition": "\n# TDD Mode\n\nIn TDD mode, based on the TDD philosophy, we proceed step by step with test addition, test modification, and refactoring.\n\nIf a file includes `@tdd` at the beginning, it's in test-first mode.\n\n### Concept: Tests are Specifications\n\nTests are considered to represent specifications. Please infer specifications from the module's README.md and test list.\n\n```\n$ bun test <module> --coverage\n```\n\n### Test Implementation Order\n\nTest code is implemented in the following order:\n\n1. Write the expected result (assertion) first\n2. Confirm the validity of the assertion with the user\n3. Once confirmed, write the operation (Act) code\n4. Finally, write the preparation (Arrange) code\n\nThis differs from the execution order (Arrange → Act → Assert). Starting implementation from the result clarifies the purpose before proceeding with implementation.\n\nImplementation example:\n\n```ts\n// @script @tdd\nimport { err, ok, Result } from \"neverthrow\";\n\n// Type definition\nexport interface User {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n}\n\nexport type ApiError =\n  | { type: \"unauthorized\"; message: string }\n  | { type: \"network\"; message: string };\n\n// Interface definition\ndeclare function getUser(\n  token: string,\n  id: string,\n): Promise<Result<User, ApiError>>;\n\nimport { expect, test } from \"bun:test\";\n\ntest(\"When given a valid token, retrieving user information should succeed\", async () => {\n  // 1. First write the expected result\n  const expectedUser: User = {\n    id: \"1\",\n    name: \"Test User\",\n  };\n\n  // 2. Confirm the validity of the result with the user\n\n  // 3. Next write the operation\n  const result = await getUser(\"valid-token\", \"1\");\n\n  // 4. Finally write the preparation (not needed in this example)\n\n  // Assertion\n  expect(result.isOk()).toBe(true);\n  result.map((user) => {\n    expect(user).toEqual(expectedUser);\n  });\n});\n\ntest(\"When given an invalid token, retrieving user information should fail\", async () => {\n  // 1. First write the expected result\n  const expectedError: ApiError = {\n    type: \"unauthorized\",\n    message: \"Invalid token\",\n  };\n\n  // 2. Confirm the validity of the result with the user\n\n  // 3. Next write the operation\n  const result = await getUser(\"invalid-token\", \"1\");\n\n  // Assertion\n  expect(result.isErr()).toBe(true);\n  result.mapErr((error) => {\n    expect(error).toEqual(expectedError);\n  });\n});\n```\n\n### Test and Assertion Naming Conventions\n\nTest names are written in the following format:\n\n```\n\"When {situation}, {operation} should {result}\"\n```\n\nExamples:\n\n- \"When given a valid token, retrieving user information should succeed\"\n- \"When given an invalid token, retrieving user information should fail\"\n\n### Detailed Development Procedure\n\n1. Define type signatures\n   ```ts\n   declare function getUser(\n     token: string,\n     id: string,\n   ): Promise<Result<User, ApiError>>;\n   ```\n\n   Add export for libraries\n\n2. For each test case:\n\n   a. Define the expected result\n   ```ts\n   const expectedUser: User = {\n     id: \"1\",\n     name: \"Test User\",\n   };\n   ```\n\n   b. **Confirm the result with the user**\n   - At this point, confirm if the expected result is appropriate\n   - If specification review or additions are needed, modify here\n\n   c. Implement operation code\n   ```ts\n   const result = await getUser(\"valid-token\", \"1\");\n   ```\n\n   d. Implement necessary preparation code\n   ```ts\n   // Only if needed\n   const mockApi = new MockApi();\n   mockApi.setup();\n   ```\n\nTDD mode is compatible with other modes.\n\n## TDD Example in Bun\n\nThis example demonstrates the Test-Driven Development (TDD) process in Bun.\n\n### Directory Structure\n\n```\ntdd-example/\n  index.ts   - Public interface (re-exports only)\n  lib.ts     - Implementation (using imports from deps.ts)\n  index.test.ts - Test code\n```\n\n### Actual TDD Procedure (Steps)\n\n1. **Write tests**: Write test cases in `index.test.ts` that define the expected behavior of the code.\n2. **Confirm test failure**: Verify that the tests fail because there's no implementation yet.\n3. **Implement code**: Implement code in `lib.ts` that satisfies the test cases.\n4. **Confirm test success**: Verify that the tests pass.\n\n### Procedure for Adding Failing Tests\n\n1. **Confirm tests pass**: Run `bun test --coverage` to verify that all tests pass.\n2. **Add a failing test**: Add a new test case to `index.test.ts`. This test should fail because the implementation doesn't exist yet.\n3. **Confirm test failure**: Run `bun test tdd-example` to verify that the added test fails.\n4. **Run only the failing test**: Run `bun test tdd-example --filter \"<test name>\"` to run only the failing test. Replace `<test name>` with the name of the failing test.\n5. **Make types pass**: Define the function in `lib.ts` and re-export it in `index.ts`. Implement it with `throw new Error(\"wip\")`.\n6. **Implement**: Write the implementation in `lib.ts` that makes the test pass.\n\n### Refactor Phase\n\nAfter the tests pass, suggest refactoring to the user.\n\n- `bun run typecheck <target>`\n- `bun run lint <target>`\n\n#### Measuring and Checking Code Coverage\n\nAfter tests pass, it's recommended to measure code coverage to verify that tests cover all parts of the code.\n\n1. Collect coverage data:\n   ```bash\n   bun test --coverage <test file>\n   ```\n\n2. Generate and check coverage report:\n   ```bash\n   bun test --coverage\n   ```\n\n3. Check detailed report:\n   ```bash\n   bun test --coverage\n   ```\n\nIf coverage is not 100%, consider adding test cases to improve coverage.\n\n#### Using TSR for Dead Code Removal\n\nAfter tests pass, it's also recommended to use TSR (TypeScript Remove) to detect dead code (unused code).\n\n1. First detect dead code:\n   ```bash\n   bun run tsr 'index\\\\.ts$'\n   ```\n\n2. Check detection results:\n   - Unused exports and files will be displayed\n   - Note: Test files are detected as dead code because they're not referenced from entry points\n\n3. Confirm with the user whether to delete:\n   - \"TSR detected the following dead code. Do you want to delete it?\"\n   - Only if the user agrees, run the following command:\n     ```bash\n     bun run tsr --write 'index\\\\.ts$'\n     ```\n   - To exclude test files:\n     ```bash\n     bun run tsr --write 'index\\\\.ts$' '.*\\\\.test\\\\.ts$'\n     ```\n\nRemoving dead code keeps the codebase clean and makes future maintenance easier.\n\n#### Using Git Workflow\n\nIn the TDD process, it's important to properly version control changes at each phase. The following Git workflow is recommended:\n\n1. **Check commit status**:\n   ```bash\n   git status\n   ```\n   - Check the current state of changes before starting work or transitioning between steps\n\n2. **Commit after test modification**:\n   - After adding or modifying tests, ask the user if they want to commit\n   - \"I've modified the tests. Do you want to commit this?\"\n   - If the user agrees, consider a commit message and execute:\n     ```bash\n     git add <changed files>\n     git commit -m \"test: Add tests for XX functionality\"\n     ```\n\n3. **Commit after implementation**:\n   - After implementing to make tests pass, ask the user if they want to commit\n   - \"Implementation is complete. Do you want to commit this?\"\n   - If the user agrees:\n     ```bash\n     git add <changed files>\n     git commit -m \"feat: Implement XX functionality\"\n     ```\n\n4. **Commit after refactoring**:\n   - After refactoring, ask the user if they want to commit\n   - \"Refactoring is complete. Do you want to commit this?\"\n   - If the user agrees:\n     ```bash\n     git add <changed files>\n     git commit -m \"refactor: Refactor XX implementation\"\n     ```\n\n5. **Creating commit messages**:\n   - Analyze the change log and consider appropriate commit messages\n   - Use prefixes to clarify intent:\n     - `test:` - Adding/modifying tests\n     - `feat:` - Implementing new features\n     - `fix:` - Bug fixes\n     - `refactor:` - Code refactoring\n     - `docs:` - Documentation updates\n     - `chore:` - Changes to build process or tools\n\nBy committing at each step, the TDD cycle is clearly recorded, making it easier to track changes later.\n\n### TypeFirst Mode\n\nWhen asked to think about types together, it's TypeFirst mode.\n\nFirst write the type signatures of the implementation and test code. Only perform type checking, and if type checking passes, propose the type signatures to the user.\n\nOnce the type signatures are confirmed, write how they would be used as test code. When asked \"What would the specification look like with these type signatures?\", write test code.\n\nAfter agreeing on the specification, proceed to implementation."

      "roleDefinition": "\n## Module\n\nDescribing Bun modules\n\nModule mode consists of multiple files under a directory.\n\nExample:\n\n```\nmodules/xxx/\n  index.ts   - Exports for external use (re-exports only)\n  deps.ts    - Imports from other modules' index.ts and re-exports features used within the module\n  lib.ts     - Implementation (using imports from deps.ts)\n  types.ts   - Type definitions\n  lib.test.ts\n  test/*.test.ts - Integration tests describing specifications for index.ts\nmodules/minimum/\n  index.ts   - Exports for external use (re-exports only)\n  index.test.ts\n  lib.ts     - Implementation (using imports from deps.ts)\n```\n\n`lib.ts` is where the initial implementation is placed, but when the code volume increases, it should be split with DDD in mind.\n\nTo test a module, run `bun test modules/<name>/*.test.ts`.\n\n### How to Read a Module\n\nBefore directly reading the source code, check the module in the following order:\n\n- read-file `README.md` to understand the overview\n- Check the API to understand the specifications\n- Run `bun test modules/<name>` to understand the specifications from test cases\n\nWhen referencing external modules from a module, prioritize checking the API documentation. Reading the implementation should be the last resort.\n\n### When Tests Fail\n\nFollow these steps:\n\nFor feature additions:\n\n1. For feature additions, first check if all tests pass with `bun test modules/<name>`\n2. After modification, test the target script or module\n\nFor fixes:\n\n1. Run `bun test modules/<name>/**.test.ts` to test the module\n2. Check the failing module's tests and refer to the implementation\n\n- Run tests one by one: `bun test modules/<name>/foo.test.ts`\n\n3. Consider step by step why it's failing (don't make blind fixes!)\n4. Modify the implementation. If necessary, insert print debugging to check the execution process\n5. Check the module test execution results\n\n- If fixed, remove print debugging\n- If not fixed, return to step 3\n\n5. Check overall tests outside the module\n\nIf tests fail, don't proceed to the next module until the failing tests are fixed.\n\n### Module File Roles and Context Boundaries\n\nA module's context is completely defined by two files: index.ts and deps.ts:\n\n- index.ts: Module's public interface\n  - Exports implementations to the outside\n  - Other modules are prohibited from directly importing from anywhere else\n  - Contains only re-exports, no implementations\n  - Just by looking at this file, you can understand what functionality the module provides\n\n- deps.ts: Module dependency definition\n  - Imports from other modules' index.ts\n  - Re-exports features used within the module\n  - Centralizes external dependencies here\n  - Just by looking at this file, you can understand the module's dependencies\n\nOther files:\n\n- types.ts: Consolidates type definitions within the module\n- lib.ts: Responsible for implementation\n  - When code volume is small (less than 150 lines), implementation under lib.ts is acceptable\n  - When volume is large, split into multiple files\n  - Within implementation, use imports from deps.ts\n  - Not directly referenced from outside the module\n- *.test.ts: Test files\n  - Place in the same directory as implementation files\n  - Create test files that correspond 1:1 with implementation files\n\nThis structure ensures:\n\n- Module dependencies are transparent\n- The impact range of code changes is predictable\n- Low coupling between modules is maintained\n- Refactoring is easier\n\nIn module mode, unlike script mode, direct references to npm packages are recommended. When referencing a module, add the dependency to package.json with `bun add packageName`.\n\n```ts\n// OK\nimport { z } from \"zod\";\n\n// Not OK\nimport { z } from \"zod@3.21.4\";"
